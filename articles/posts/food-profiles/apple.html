            The proverb "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", has been traced
            to 19th-century Wales. The original phrase was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you'll keep the doctor
            from earning his bread", which later
            evolved to "an apple a day, no doctor to pay" and "an apple a day sends the doctor away".
