    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <h4>The magic behind</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Roasting the nuts would speed up the blending process. However this does give the butter a certain flavour,
            which
            some love
            and some don't - it is all in the taste buds.
        </li>
        <li>
            The coconut flavour combines really nicely with butters such as Almond and Peanut, experiment with
            unsweetened
            shredded coconut - simply add it to the nuts in the blender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use spices or natural flavouring to make your butter more exciting. Cinnamon and vanilla are classic choices
            and
            you would be surpirised at the blend of flavours and aroma they create.
        </li>
        <li>
            Play with mixing nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews, walnuts...), you can vary your proportions and choose how
            many to combine.
