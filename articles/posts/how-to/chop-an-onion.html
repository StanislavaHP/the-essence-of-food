    <h4>The magic behind</h4>
    <p>If you hate cutting onions owing to all the crying involved, we have you sorted. If you wear contact lenses
        simply make sure to have them on. That's it - you are now immuned. Wearing googles which keep the air
        out also helps - swimming googles would do. Glasses won't. If you try the googles idea, please feel free to
        share your pictures with us. </p>
    <p>
        Put your onion in a blender - no crying involved - the machine protects you and it would do the job faster
        than you. Unfortunately there is the additional cleaning of the blender involved but you
        can't have it all.
