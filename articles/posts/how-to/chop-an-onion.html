        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
            <span class="steps">Step 5</span> Chop either along the x or y axis, then switch around. (yes, we somehow
            managed
            to get maths involved) Always chop from the top, not from the side.

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <h4>The magic behind</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you hate cutting onions courtesy to all the crying involved, we got your back. If you wear contact lenses
            simply make sure to have them on. That's it - you are now immuned. Wearing googles which keep the air
            out also helps - swimming googles would do. Glasses won't. If you try the googles tip, please feel free to
            share your pictures with us.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put your onion in a blender - no crying involved - the machine protects you and it would do the job faster
            than you. Unfortunately there is the additional cleaning of the blender involved but you
            can't have it all.
