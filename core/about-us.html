        <h2>A short intro: </h2>

        <p>
            Welcome to our small corner of the web. Here, you would be able to find an assorted list of recipes and
            nutrition articles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to share our love for healthy food. We believe nowadays, some basic understanding of
            the
            nutritional value of the foods we eat is key for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. We try to convey this
            information
            in a fun and approachable way.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of our recipes contain key nutrition information, while our
            articles
            would
            help
            you digest it.

        <h2>Followed by a deep dive:</h2>

        <p> 
            We endeavour to firmly defend the three cornerstones of good food: Diverse, Nutritious and Delicious.
        </p>

        <section class="diverse">
            <h4>Diverse</h4>
            <p>
                There is immense variety of food on Earth and plenty of options are easily accessible on affordable
                prices. Don't take us at our word, we more than encourage you to embark on your
                healthy
                journey with a stroll to your local supermarket. Explore the fruits and vegetable sections, pick a few
                you
                haven't tried before or you haven't eaten in a long while and give them a go... You hated the weird
                looking
                fruit we just encouraged you to take, didn't you - well we didn't say you would like every new thing you
                try, but at least you did and now you know. But we bet you, you are bound to find new jems of
                nutritional
                goodness which you might not only like but love.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't stick to a handful of ingredients. Eating a diverse
                diet is important. Try different nuts and seeds, beans, legumes and grains. Cook with variety of spices
                and
                herbs, just explore. Think of it as a nutritional adventure - you don't know what is waiting for you
                around
                the corner.

                What would you get out of this?
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    your food will keep you on edge - food and boring do not belong in the same sentence
                </li>
                <li>
                    you would get a variety of nutrients you might otherwise be inadvertently omitting
                </li>
            </ol>

        <section class ="nutritious">
            <h4>Nutritious</h4>
            <p>
                Our body needs a set of minerals and vitamins so it can function properly. Each of them has their own
                responsibility. It is important to get a basic understanding of the role they play and the foods which
                supply us with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some foods are super contributors. Consuming small quantities
                can cover your daily or even weekly mineral / vitamin requirements. 
                Super indeed!
            </p>
            <p>
                Others are a good source when compared against other options, but you need to consistently incorporate
                them into your diet in order to meet your nutritional needs.
                Potassium for example is an important mineral. Though it can be found in a lot of vegetables and fruits
                unless you eat plenty of both you wouldn't get enough. But don't worry veggies and fruits' reputation as
                boring is completely undeserved - if prepared
                well you wouldn't be able to get enough of them.
            </p>

        <section class="delicious">
            <h4>Delicious</h4>
            <p>
                It is a huge misconception that healthy food cannot be delicious. Yes it can! It is all about the
                ingredients! </p>
            <p> "Do not play with your food" - not here, here we
                encourage you to play with your food, mix ingredients, try new techniques. Try new recipes (plenty of
                those
                here). Spices are your friends - best friends.
            </p>
            <p>Enjoy your food, allow your taste buds to fully appreciate the flavour, immerse your senses into
                every bite your have.If you don't like it, don't eat it - we believe there is plenty of alternatives
                out
                there to force yourself into eating foods you simply don't enjoy. </p>
            <p>Check with your body after each meal,
                do
                you feel more energetic, do you feel satisfied? Good food should make you feel good both while and
                after
                you have eaten it.
